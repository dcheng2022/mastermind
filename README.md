# mastermind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players. A codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs, which the codebreaker must guess in 12 turns. After every turn the codebreaker is provided feedback on the order and colors of their guess. Another guess is made until the codebreaker guesses correctly or exceeds the number of provided turns.
